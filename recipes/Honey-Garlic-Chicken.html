        <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, to season</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water (or chicken broth)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice win vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or any white vinegar)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder;set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan or skillet over medium high heat; sear chicken thigh fillets or breast fillets on both sides until golden and cooked through</li>
    </ol>
    <p><h4>For bone in thighs:</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Reduce heat after searing on both sides, cover skillet with a lid and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, while turning every 5 minutes until done. Alternatively, see notes for oven method.</li>
        <li>Drain most of the excess oil from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons of pan juiced for added flavour.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><h4>For sauce:</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>When chicken is done and cooked through, arrange chicken skin-side up in the pan (if cooking with skin); add the garlic between the chicken and fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water, vinegar and soy sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the sauce reduces down and thicken slightly (about 3-4 minutes).</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a salad.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>NOTES</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><em>*For chicken breasts: use 3 breasts, sliced horizontally in half. Sear breast fillets on each side until golden and cooked through (about 6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of your fillets). Continue directions from the sauce, onwards.**For oven baked, bone-in thighs: Preheat oven at 400°F or 200°C. Sear chicken in an oven proof skillet or pan, skin side down first for 3 minutes. Flip and sear for a further 3 minutes until browned each side. Then bake in the oven for a further 20-25 minutes, until completely cooked through and no longer pink inside. Continue directions from the sauce, onwards.</em></li>
